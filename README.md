Our team would like to research and develop an isurance solution to mitigate on chain hacks.
The peer to peer nature of insurance solutions on blockchains enables some crucial advantages over any traditional insurance offering that exists on the current marke.
Besides, insuring losses that happen directly on blockchains does not exist at this time.
