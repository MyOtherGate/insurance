The core idea of insurance is a simple one, risk sharing. In the simplest case, all participants of a group are equally and randomly 
susceptible to damage. If participants contribute equally to a single fund that pays out to these random participants, the group as a 
whole and its individuals gain a few fundamental advantages. First, participants that incurred damages would have often taken years to
rehabilitate, disrupting their production and reducing the output of the group. These individuals, left without the means to rehabilitate 
would require a long time to rebuild too, wasting their precious time due to a determined random amount of destined damage.
Inherently, these statistics have held back human development throughout most of our existence.
Insurance was one of the reasons that we could flourish the way we did.
